# Cohort-analysis-and-Customer-segmentation-with-RFM

I have some problems displaying the example table of grouping customers in the notebook. Please check this before entering the notebook.

The table is on cell 36.

Use RFM score to group customers. The below table is an example of grouping customers.
| Customer Segment | Activity | Actionable Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Champions | Bought recently, buy often and spend the most! | Reward them. Can be early adopters for new products. Will promote your brand. |
| Loyal Customers | Spend good money with us often. Responsive to promotions. | Upsell higher value products. Ask for reviews. Engage them. |
| Potential Loyalist | Recent customers, but spent a good amount and bought more than once. | Offer membership / loyalty program, recommend other products. |
| Recent Customers | Bought most recently, but not often. | Provide on-boarding support, give them early success, start building relationship. |
| Promising | Recent shoppers, but haven’t spent much. | Create brand awareness, offer free trials. |
| Customers Needing Attention | Above average recency, frequency and monetary values. May not have bought very recently though. | Make limited time offers, Recommend based on past purchases. Reactivate them. |
| About To Sleep | Below average recency, frequency and monetary values. Will lose them if not reactivated.	| Share valuable resources, recommend popular products / renewals at discount, reconnect with them. |
| At Risk | Spent big money and purchased often. But long time ago. Need to bring them back! | Send personalized emails to reconnect, offer renewals, provide helpful resources. |
| Can’t Lose Them | Made biggest purchases, and often. But haven’t returned for a long time. | Win them back via renewals or newer products, don’t lose them to competition, talk to them. |
| Hibernating | Last purchase was long back, low spenders and low number of orders. | Offer other relevant products and special discounts. Recreate brand value. |
| Lost | Lowest recency, frequency and monetary scores.	| Revive interest with reach out campaign, ignore otherwise. |
